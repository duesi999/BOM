Data School Focus practice challenge:

Challenge: Putting it all together

As a final challenge, you will work in pairs to complete an end to end data analysis task in a reproducible fashion
Getting the data

Create a new RStudio project for this analysis
Download two data files from the Bureau of Meterology, one containing meterological information, and one containing metadata about weather stations
Take some time to explore the data files and understand what they contain
Write a script that answers the following questions:

Question 1

For each station, how many days have a minimum temperature, a maximum temperature and a rainfall measurement recorded?

Question 2

Which month saw the lowest average daily temperature difference?

Question 3

Which state saw the lowest average daily temperature difference?

Question 4

Does the westmost (lowest longitude) or eastmost (highest longitude) weather station in our dataset have a higher average solar exposure?
